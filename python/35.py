'''
This exercise is Part 3 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. 
The other exercises are: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 4.

In the previous exercise we saved information about famous scientistsâ€™ names and birthdays to disk. 
In this exercise, load that JSON file from disk, extract the months of all the birthdays, 
and count how many scientists have a birthday in each month.

Your program should output something like:

{
	"May": 3,
	"November": 2,
	"December": 1
}
